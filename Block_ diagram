This project uses an ultrasonic pulse that is reflected by an object to
determine how far it is away and how many LEDs will glow as a
result. We need a smart street light system because there is
currently too much power loss in street lights to serve this purpose.
We offer one suggestion for a more effective method of energy
conservation. We also think about how effective our prototype is.
Today, smart parking systems are also required. In our project, we
provide an IoT-based solution by indicating using LEDs,
visualisation tools, labels, etc., for the safety of the vehicle's driver
and the vehicle. We employ various approaches to demonstrate both
modern-day problems in the same prototype. versus all other
sensors Because the driver cannot see the distance from the rear of
the car between the nearby objects and the car body, ultrasonic
sensor measurement is safe and assists the equipment while a car is
parking or reversing.
â€¢ They provide instructions on how to determine distances between a
few millimetres and a few metres in the journal article "A Distance
Measurement Ultrasonic Sensor for Automotive Use." They stated
that "Smart cars" would use these applications. With that concept,
we're attempting to increase measurement accuracy while
simultaneously creating a tool that allows users to see distance.


For the purpose of implementing the smart street light application, we
consulted the article "Designing LED street lighting to be as efficient as
possible." In this article, the authors discussed ways to save energy by
optimising LED lamps. Using these ideas, we tried to implement the
smart street light system by combining them with a feature that would
reduce the intensity of the LEDs' glow if no vehicles were detected at the
time. In our prototype, we manually visualise the energy savings. We
must store the data for the Energy Audit, so we are doing so in the IoT
cloud.
