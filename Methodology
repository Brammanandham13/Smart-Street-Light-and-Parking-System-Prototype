First, we obtain the data from the ultrasonic sensor (the trigger pin,
D0 in the Nodemcu and pin 11, in the Arduino, will generate the
signal, which the echo pin, D1, in the Nodemcu and pin 12, in the
Arduino, will receive).Receiving Signal isthe wavelength between the
signal sendingand Receiving by using distance, wavelength relation
we have to calculate the Distance.

• The distance is transferred to the Arduino IDE, where we can send data
to the processing software using the serial port COM and to the
ThingsBoard/Blynk IoT App via the WiFi Module.

• I construct the new gadget first in ThingsBoard. I can acquire the
credentials there. The Add New Widget Option is then used to create the
New Dashboard. The distance between the object and the sensor is
visualised using a digital gauge and a time series line chart. I can access
the Blynk IoT App after creating the login for the Blynk Dashboard and
creating my authentication token from the token. I built widgets like a
gauge, a clock, and a simple live timeline inside the app.

• For the purpose of storing the data needed to perform the energy audit in
our prototype, we are creating a new channel and field in ThingSpeak as
well as a widget to display the data.
